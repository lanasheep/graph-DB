### examples:

#### patterns
```
a S (a | b)*
() | (a S)*
```
#### named patterns
```
S = a S b | ()
A = (a)*
```
#### connect
```
connect to [\home\user\graph_db]
```
#### list

###### by default displays graphs from the connected database if no path is specified
```
list all
list all [\home\user\another_graph_db]
```
###### print set of different edge labels in the specified graph
```
list [\home\user\agraph_db\graph1.txt]
```
#### select statements

###### it is possible to specify the vertex number or write underscore instead (vertex with any number)
###### getting all pairs of vertices that match the conditions:
```
select get from [graph1.txt] where (_) - (a | b)* -> (_)
```
###### finding the number of pairs of vertices that match the conditions:
```
select count from [graph1.txt] where (2) - (a | b)* -> (_)
```
###### checking for the existence of a pair of vertices that match the conditions:
```
select exists from [graph1.txt] where (1) - S -> (3)
```
###### it is possible to specify the used algorithm: "using hellings", "using matrices" or "using tensors" (by default the algorithm with tensors is used):
```
select count from [graph1.txt] where (2) - (a | b)* -> (_) using hellings
```
###### adding a graph expression means that between the required pairs of vertices there must be a path belonging to the language generated by this expression

```
select count from intersec ([graph1.txt], compl ([graph2.txt])) [graph3.txt] where (_) - S -> (3)
```
#### script
```
connect to [\home\user\graph_db];
S = a S b S | ();
select count from [graph.txt] where (_) - S -> (1);
```
